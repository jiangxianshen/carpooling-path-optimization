# Path Optimization of Carpooling
Path Optimization of Carpooling implementation using networkx, google OR tool in python3 
Please read project_report.pdf for code design.

## Problem Statement / Specification
Please read spec.pdf for specific problem description.

## Code Design
Please read https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S2Xxs47H0cYT5xCnsJIwKnxy4bzVv_kXxMWXIR9YAYc/edit

## Prerequisites
Make sure to install these tools first

Numpy https://www.scipy.org/install.html
```bash
pip install numpy
```
Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html
```bash
pip install pandas
```
pycountry https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/
```bash
pip install pycountry
```
Google OR Tool https://developers.google.com/optimization/install
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools
```
NetworkX https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html
```bash
pip install pip install networkx
```
Matplotlib for visualization of graphs https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html
```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```
Also, please install the current repository

Everything should be ready to go at this point, so let's run some Python code, 
```bash
python solver.py inputs/174_50.in outputs
```

## How to run
Please go to version_yes_walking

To run one input generated by input_generator.py
```
python solver.py (path to a .in file) (path to save .out files) to run one input
```
To run all inputs
```
python solver.py --all (path to .in files) (path to directory to save .out files) 
```
Examples
```
python solver.py inputs/174_50.in outputs
```
```
python solver.py --all inputs outputs
```
To generate a problem(graph,input, .in file) / you can decide the number of locations and the number of homes in the code.
```
python3 input_generator.py
```
To check whether a problem(graph, .in file) generated is valid
```
Similar way for input_validator.py
```
To check whether all problem(graph, .in files) generated are valid
```
Similar way for input_validator.py
```
To check whether a solution(.out file) generated is valid
```
Similar way for output_validator.py
```
To check whether all solutions(.out files) generated are valid
```
Similar way for output_validator.py
```
